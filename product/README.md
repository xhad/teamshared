# product/ — TeamShared product planning (mogkit workspace)

A [mogkit](https://github.com/Waddling-Penguin/mogkit) PM workspace for planning
**TeamShared**. mogkit is a collection of product playbooks (stored in teamshared
under the `mogkit` tag) that turn raw research into an evidence graph and then
interrogate it — surfacing what's actually supported, what's assumed, and what to
validate next. The playbooks never write the PRD for you; they make *your*
thinking sharper.

## Layout

```
product/
├── sources/      raw research (one file per artifact); graphify reads these
│                 currently: symlinks to the repo's internal planning docs
├── engine/
│   └── graph-schema.json   the contract graphify output must satisfy
├── graph/
│   ├── graph.json          the evidence graph (schema-valid, provenance on every node/edge)
│   └── graph.md            human-readable summary + health banner
├── knowledge/
│   └── assumption-audit.md the 8 load-bearing bets ranked by decision-at-risk
└── README.md
```

## Current state

The graph was built from **internal product intent** (`prod-plan.md`,
`plan.md`, `memory-wiki-plan.md`, plus `README.md`/`AGENTS.md`) and **two
external signals** (`company-brain-yc-rfs.md`, `gbrain-competitor-research.md`,
`palantir-foundry-ontology-research.md`). Corpus health is still **thin** — there
is no captured user research yet. The headline finding: the plan is detailed, but
the core bets have **zero user evidence**. GBrain is the primary named competitor
(`knowledge/gbrain-competitor-analysis.md`); Palantir Foundry ontology is the main
architectural reference for a governed entity/action layer (`knowledge/palantir-ontology-analysis.md`).
See `knowledge/assumption-audit.md`.

## How to move it forward

1. **Add real research.** Drop interview transcripts, support tickets, or sales
   call notes into `sources/` (with `type:` frontmatter). Re-run `graphify`.
2. **Discovery wedge** (graph-based): `graphify` → `assumption-audit` →
   `discovery-query` → `interview-guide` → `synthesis-map` → `prd-interrogate`.
3. **Standalone skills** (no graph needed) that fit TeamShared right now:
   - `metrics-tree` — TeamShared has no measurable outcome; give it one.
   - `narrative-review` — pressure-test `prod-plan.md` as an exec would.
   - `spec-stress-test` — red-team the consent-first capture spec.
   - `tradeoff-frame` — frame shared-by-default vs isolated-by-default honestly.

Run a playbook by fetching it from teamshared: `memory_procedure_get(name="graphify")`.
